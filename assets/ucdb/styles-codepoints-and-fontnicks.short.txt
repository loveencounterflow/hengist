# Mappings from styles to fonts modulo codepoint ranges and individual codepoints.

# The second field of each line will be turned into a CID (codepoint) range `[c1..c2]`; then, in order to
# find the appropriate font and glyph formatting for a given styletag `tx` and codepoint `cx`, the last
# record where both the styletag matches the one given and the codepoint is within the range given `c1 <= cx
# <= c2` yields the fontnick and glyphstyle for that style and codepoint.

# Use this font for all codepoints when the style is heavy (black) Ming:
+style:ming,weight:900css     *                         sourcehanserifheavytaiwan

# Use this font for regular weight Ming style:
# +style:ming                   *                         sunexta

# Use these fonts for specific codepoint ranges:
+style:ming                   *                         lmromantenregular
+style:ming                   rsg:u-cjk                 sunexta
+style:ming                   '丁'                      takaopgothic
