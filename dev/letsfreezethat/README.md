# Let's Freeze That!

[LetsFreezeThat](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/letsfreezethat) is an unapologetically minimal library
to make working with immutable objects in JavaScript less of a chore.

# Notes

* LFT does not copy objects on explicit or implicit `freeze()`. That should be fine for most use cases since
  what one usually wants to do is either create or thaw a given value (which implies making a copy),
  manipulate (i.e. mutate) it, and then freeze it prior to passing it on. As long as manipulations are local
  to a not-too-long single function, chances of screwing up are limited, so we can safely forgo the added
  overhead of making an additional copy when either `freeze()` is called or a call to `lets d, ( d ) -> ...`
  has finished.

* LFT comes in two configurable flavors: `LFT = ( require 'letsfreezethat' ).new { freeze: true, }` (which
  is the same as `LFT = require 'letsfreezethat'`) and `LFT = ( require 'letsfreezethat' ).new { freeze:
  false, }` which forgoes freezing (but not copying).

* The non-freezing configuration is a tad faster on `thaw()` and â‰ˆ5 times faster on `freeze()`.

* The `thaw()` method will always make a copy even when `{ freeze: false, }` is given; otherwise it is
  hardly conceivable how an application could switch from the slower `{ freeze: true, }` configuration to
  the faster `{ freeze: false, }` without breaking.

* In the case a list or an object originates from the outside and other places might still hold references
  to that value or one of its properties, one can use `thaw()` to make sure any mutations will not be
  visible from the outside. In this regard, `thaw()` could have been called `deep_copy()`.

# To Do

* [ ] preserve symbol attributes when freezing
* [ ] consider to offer an implementation of HAMT
  (https://blog.mattbierner.com/persistent-hash-tries-in-javavascript/, https://github.com/mattbierner/hamt,
  https://github.com/mattbierner/hamt_plus (? https://github.com/mattbierner/hashtrie)) for the frequent use
  case of immutable maps
